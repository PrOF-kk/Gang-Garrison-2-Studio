/*
 * Together with the RoomChangeObserver object, this script enables the following behaviour:
 * If you consistently use room_goto_fix instead of room_goto, all instances that are removed from the game
 * because of the room change will have their Destroy event called. Also, all instances that are added to
 * the game as part of a room change will have their Create events called.
 * If this script is called while a room change is already in progress, the new change will be delayed until
 * the running change is completed.
 *
 * This has not been tested much and might cause problems with things like persistent rooms.
